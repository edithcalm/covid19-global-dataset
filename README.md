# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a comprehensive data analysis and visualization notebook that tracks global COVID-19 trends using real-world data. It covers cases, deaths, and vaccination metrics across selected countries and over time. The goal is to draw insights through data cleaning, exploration, and meaningful visualizations.

##  Project Description

The **COVID-19 Global Data Tracker** analyzes the spread and impact of COVID-19 using the Our World in Data dataset. It presents a clean, structured Jupyter Notebook with:
- Cleaned data for select countries (e.g., Kenya, USA, India)
- Line and bar charts illustrating trends
- Vaccination rollout tracking
- Death rate analysis
- Optional choropleth maps for global comparison

## Features

Data loading and cleaning with `pandas`  
Time series analysis (cases, deaths, vaccinations)  
Country comparison using visualizations  
Vaccination progress evaluation  
Insightful markdown summaries  
Optional: Global choropleth map using `plotly`

## Dataset Source

- [Our World in Data COVID-19 Dataset](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv)

## Visualizations

- Line charts: Total cases, deaths, vaccinations over time  
- Bar charts: Country comparisons  
- Death rate trends  
-  Choropleth map (optional): Visualizing global cases

## Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (for choropleth map)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Insights

- India experienced the steepest case rise during the Delta wave in mid-2021.
- The United States leads in total vaccinations but still reports high new case counts.
- Kenya reports lower case and death countsâ€”potentially due to limited testing or reporting delays.
- Death rates have declined post-vaccine rollout, highlighting vaccine effectiveness.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository.
2. Download the dataset from [Our World in Data](https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv).
3. Place the CSV file in the project directory.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell sequentially.

## Deliverable

A Jupyter Notebook with:
- Well-documented code
- Interactive and static visualizations
- Markdown explanations
- Summary of insights
